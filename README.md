# Sobel-Edge-Image-Operator-Java
A GUI application was created for the project carried out within the scope of Advance Programming course, where each tab will show a different aspect of an image that
is provided for you. Please make sure to use the image provided by the given documentation

Tab 0 : Show the original image in this tab
- ![Tab0](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Sobel-Edge-Image-Operator-Java/blob/main/Outputs%20%26%20Screenshots/Original.png)

Tab 1 : You will create the edge image of the given image.In this tab, you will show the edge in the x direction of the given image.Showing only the Gx Edge
- ![Xedge](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Sobel-Edge-Image-Operator-Java/blob/main/Outputs%20%26%20Screenshots/X%20Edge.png)

Tab 2 : You will create another tab that shows the edge image in the y direction.Showing only the Gy
- ![GyEdge](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Sobel-Edge-Image-Operator-Java/blob/main/Outputs%20%26%20Screenshots/Y%20Edge.png)

Tab 3 : Show the edge image of the given image combining both Gx and Gy
- ![Combine](https://github.com/abdulfettahsancakli/Sobel-Edge-Image-Operator-Java/blob/main/Outputs%20%26%20Screenshots/XY%20Edge.png)

Tab 5 :Click somewhere in the original image (Tab 0) which will mark the top left corner of the image. Then click another point in the original image to mark the bottom right
corner of the image that you will make a copy of. The rectangle that you marked the top left and bottom right corners of will be expanded by doubling it in a different tab.
That is, each pixel of the chosen rectangle of the original image will be shown as 4 pixels in a differnt tab (Tab 5) where the original image pixels are copied (Again, each
original image pixel is now a 2x2 pixels where each of the 4 pixles is the copy of the original image pixel.
